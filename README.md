Overview:
The Project:
In this project, the following objectives were accomplished:

1. Creating a responsive layout that adapts to various screen sizes.
2. Implementing hover states for all interactive elements on the webpage.
3. Offering the option to play the game solo against the computer or multiplayer against another person.
4. Bonus 1: Saving the game state in the browser, ensuring it persists even after a browser refresh.
5. Bonus 2: Enhancing the computer's intelligence to make strategic moves, blocking the player's moves and aiming for a win.

My Approach:
Technologies Used:
The project was built using the following technologies and methodologies:

1. Semantic HTML5 markup
2. CSS custom properties
3. Flexbox
4. CSS Grid
5. Mobile-first workflow
6. Implementation of the Minimax Algorithm

Key Takeaways:
During this project, I gained valuable insights and skills:

1. I learned a new method for handling SVGs, which allowed for quick color changes, different from my typical use of the img tag.
2. I deepened my understanding of arrays and their manipulation to achieve the desired game outcomes.
3. I explored the use of "async await" and promises.
4. For the first time, I developed and implemented the Minimax algorithm to enhance the computer's intelligence and enable it to make optimal moves in the game.

Future Development:
In the future, I plan to further refine my JavaScript skills and optimize my code for better performance.
